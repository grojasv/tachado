App-like mobile UX (high impact)
- [ ] Theme/status bar polish: set `<meta name="theme-color">` to match background
- [ ] iOS status bar style: `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style=black-translucent`
- [ ] Web Share API: use native share sheet on mobile; fallback to copy
- [ ] ‚ÄúDeshacer‚Äù snackbar: undo after swipe-to-delete (5s)
- [ ] Input UX: `enterkeyhint="done"`, autofocus on first load, clear-on-add, select-on-focus
- [ ] Micro‚Äëhaptics: softer taps for reorder, stronger for delete; respect reduced motion
- [ ] Tap targets: ensure 48px minimum on controls and drag handles

Mobile PWA feel
- [ ] Add to Home Screen hints: Android `beforeinstallprompt`; simple iOS banner with steps
- [ ] Fullscreen feel: `viewport-fit=cover`; apply safe‚Äëarea paddings to header; minimize overscroll
- [ ] Icons/splash: maskable icons 192/512, verify manifest `name`/`short_name`

Navigation and feedback
- [ ] Coach marks: one‚Äëtime tips (arrastra ‚Äú‚ãÆ‚ãÆ‚Äù, desliza para borrar)
- [ ] Empty states: friendly messages for ‚ÄúPendientes‚Äù y ‚ÄúTachados‚Äù
- [ ] Reorder feedback: debounce/suppress repeated ‚ÄúOrden actualizado‚Äù toasts

Performance polish
- [ ] Defer SortableJS load until first render/interaction
- [ ] Preconnect to Firebase domain; consider dns-prefetch
- [ ] Inline critical CSS for above‚Äëthe‚Äëfold; keep bundle lean
- [ ] Reduce layout shifts: fixed heights for skeletons; consistent spacing

Accessibility (ES)
- [ ] Live announcements in espa√±ol for add/delete/reorder (revisar cobertura)
- [ ] Stronger focus-visible outlines on interactive elements
- [ ] Increase contrast for secondary text and dividers where needed

**Deliverable**: Mobile app‚Äëlike UX with polished branding and guidance
**Test**: Feels native on iOS/Android, installable, intuitive, and accessible
**Success Metrics**:
  - App-like behavior on mobile (fullscreen, status bar, native share)
